In this repository, we discuss basic python. 
Fast Of all We Know 
```
(1)	What is Python?
(2)	Where Does python support?
(3)	Why are we Using Python rather than any other programming language?
(4)	Where do we use Python?
```

## (1)	What is Python? 
![What is Python](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116889143/201668687-84c919da-fd35-42f3-b1ca-d23641b94fcd.png)

Ans: Python is a
```
(i)	Dynamic
(ii)	High-level programming language.
(iii)	Free open source 
(iv)	Interpreted programming language
```

## (2)	Where does Python support?
Ans: Python support in 
```
(i)	Procedural programming
(ii)	Object-oriented programming
(iii)	Functional programming
(iv)	Reflective
(v)	Structural
(vi)	GUI Programming (Graphical User Interface)
```
      
## (3)	Why are we Using Python rather than any other programming language?
Ans:  Because 
```
(i)	Easy to code 
(ii)	Free and Open Source
(iii)	GUI Programming Support
(iv)	High-Level Language
(v)	Extensible feature
(vi)	Python is a Portable language (If we have python code for windows and if we want to run this code on other platforms such as Linux, Unix, and Mac then we do not need to change it.)
(vii)	Python is an Integrated language (We can easily integrate python with other languages like c, c++, etc.)
(viii)  Interpreted Language 
(ix)	Large Standard Library
(x)	Dynamically Typed Language

## (4)	Where do we use Python?
Ans:  We are using Python in 
``` 
(i)	Exploratory data analysis
(ii)	Machine Learning
(iii)	Statistics
(iv)	Model Development
(v)	Scientific Computing
(vi)	Web & Visualization
(vii)	Distributed Computing
