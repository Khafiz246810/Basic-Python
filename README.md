# (3)	Why are we Using Python rather than any other programming language?
Ans:  Because 
	Easy to code 
	Free and Open Source

	High-Level Language
	Extensible feature
	Python is a Portable language (If we have python code for windows and if we want to run this code on other platforms such as Linux, Unix, and Mac
      then we do not need to change it.)
